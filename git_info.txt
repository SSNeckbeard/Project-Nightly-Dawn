To keep both repositories in sync you want to pull the latest changes to your machine before you start working on the code.

To do this you want to execute

git pull origin {branch_name}
Or you can execute the longer version of the same request using:

git fetch
git merge origin/{branch_name}
Note: this is the same process that you would use if two or more people were working on the same repo. Which is essentially what is happening, instead of two different people working on the same repository, you have two different machines working on the same repository.

Just remember if you are starting out fresh on a new machine to run through all the basics for initializing git.

git init
git remote add origin git@github.com:username/repo.git
git pull origin master

/* do some coding */

git commit -am "my changes"
git push origin master
If you want to combine a couple steps you can do the following

git init
git clone git@github.com:username/repo.git

/* do some coding */
... same as above ...
git clone does the same as git remote add origin and git pull origin master
